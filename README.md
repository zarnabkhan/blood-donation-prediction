Predicting blood donation behavior using machine learning
# 🔬 Blood Donation Prediction Model

This project predicts whether a person is likely to donate blood based on past donation behavior. It uses classification models and real-world health-related data.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [Blood Transfusion Dataset - UCI / Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/blood-transfusion-dataset)
- Features:
  - Recency (months since last donation)
  - Frequency (total donations)
  - Monetary (blood donated)
  - Time (months since first donation)
  - Target: Whether they donated blood in March 2007

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)

## ✅ Tasks Performed
- Data cleaning & EDA
- Feature correlation & visualization
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall comparison

## 📈 Results
- Best model: Random Forest
- Accuracy: 76%
- Precision/Recall: 57%
- ROC AUC Score: 0.7481

## 📌 Key Learnings
- Importance of class balance in classification
- Understanding donor behavior patterns
- Visualizing health-related data
